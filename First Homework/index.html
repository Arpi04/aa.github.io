    <p><ins>Twenty One Pilots</ins> (stylized in all lowercase or as twenty øne piløts) is an American musical duo from Columbus, Ohio. The band was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist Tyler Joseph along with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, both of whom left in 2011. Since their departure, the line-up has consisted of Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. The duo is best known for the singles "Stressed Out", "Ride", and "Heathens". The group received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards for "Stressed Out".
  The band independently released two albums, Twenty One Pilots (2009) and Regional at Best (2011), before being signed by record label Fueled by Ramen in 2012. Their label debut, Vessel, was released in 2013. The duo achieved breakthrough success with their fourth album, Blurryface (2015), which produced the successful singles "Stressed Out" and "Ride" and became the first album in history on which every track received at least a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. The release of the single "Heathens" also made the group the first alternative artist to have two concurrent top ten singles in the United States. The duo's fifth studio album, Trench, was released on October 5, 2018.</p>
    <h3> Lyrical themes </h3>
    <p> Tyler Joseph writes lyrics that are psychodramatic in nature and usually based around his piano parts. He describes both his songwriting as well as himself as "very dramatic." Joseph claims he began writing songs because there were things he wanted to say that he didn't know how to in normal conversation. He is mostly inspired by chord progression and song structure, and his lyrics come afterwards. Joseph usually composes the music first because he has a small studio in his basement. He is able to lay down thoughts musically in terms of chord progression, come up with a melody and then fit the lyrics to that song. Their music inspire song lyrics depending on what is being imparted most of the time. However, Joseph also likes to write poetry so sometimes he'll musically create a song and then fit the poetry. Dun's energetic drumming lays down a stable, equally prominent rhythm for Joseph as he shifts between expressive lyrics of his verses and an almost melodic style of rapping during many of their songs.</p>
    <h2>Musical style</h2>
    <p> The band's musical style has been described as alternative hip hop, electropop, indie pop, pop rock, rap rock, alternative rock, rock, synth-pop, pop, electronica, electronic rock, indie rock, hip hop, and indietronica with reggae, folk, psychedelic, new wave and funk[ influences. Because their music is highly versatile and contains a mix of many genres, the duo has been difficult to categorize.</p>
